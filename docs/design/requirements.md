REQUIREMENTS

Support the following checks:

    Planned checks to implement:
    - Variable and class name check (style conventions + descriptive naming)
    - PlantUML code generator
    - Class dependency check (cyclic dependency flagging)
    
    Other fallback checks:
    - Classes that can’t be publicly constructed
    - Redundant interfaces

Have built-in flexibility for supporting more checks, supporting a different UI, and switching to a different library other than ASM for analyzing bytecode
